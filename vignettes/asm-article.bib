 abstract = {Any matrix of rank two can be displayed as a biplot which consists of a vector for each row and a vector for each column, chosen so that any element of the matrix is exactly the inner product of the vectors corresponding to its row and to its column. If a matrix is of higher rank, one may display it approximately by a biplot of a matrix of rank two which approximates the original matrix. The biplot provides a useful tool of data analysis and allows the visual appraisal of the structure of large data matrices. It is especially revealing in principal component analysis, where the biplot can show inter-unit distances and indicate clustering of units as well as display variances and correlations of the variables.},

abstract="The reading of this article will allow the readers to understand the data analysis approach which is proposed. The first paragraph gives the basic tools: the triplet (X, Q, D), the operator related to a data matrix and the coefficient RV. The two following paragraphs show how these tools are used for reading out and solving the problems of joint analysis of several data matrices and of principal component analysis with respect to instrumental variables. The conclusion recalls of the construction of this approach along the past thirty five years.",

abstract = {Abstract Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) is a geometric partitioning of variation across a multivariate data cloud, defined explicitly in the space of a chosen dissimilarity measure, in response to one or more factors in an analysis of variance design. Statistical inferences are made in a distribution-free setting using permutational algorithms. The PERMANOVA framework is readily extended to accommodate random effects, hierarchical models, mixed models, quantitative covariates, repeated measures, unbalanced and/or asymmetrical designs, and, most recently, heterogeneous dispersions among groups. Plots to accompany PERMANOVA models include ordinations of either fitted or residualized distance matrices, including multivariate analogues to main effects and interaction plots, to visualize results.}

abstract = "The biplot is a widely and powerful methodology used with multidimensional data sets to describe and display the relationships between observations and variables in an easy way. Compositional data are vectors with positive components, whose sum is constant because they represent a relative contribution of different parts to a whole; due to this property standard biplots cannot be performed with compositional data, instead of a previous transformation of the data is performed. In this paper, we extend the compositional biplot defined by Aitchison and Greenacre (2002), in order to include in the display supplementary elements which are not used in the definition of the compositional biplot. Different types of supplementary elements are considered: supplementary parts of the composition, supplementary continuous variables external to the composition, supplementary categorical variables and supplementary observations. The projection of supplementary parts of the composition is done by means of the equivalence of clr and lr biplots. The other supplementary projections are done by classical methodology. An application example with a real geological data is included."
